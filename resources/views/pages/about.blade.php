    <p class="mt-4 leading-relaxed text-gray-800">
        TBH Book Club is a personal growth development and mentoring club aimed at using reading relevant books and close
        mentoring to raise a generation of Africans who will think different, lead right and effectively,
        focus on intentionally developing their potentials and skills to solve problems and bring change to their communities.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-2 leading-relaxed text-gray-800">
        We believe our mindset influences our actions and if we renew the mindset of the youth with the right information or
        knowledge, we can raise the people Africa needs to solve our problems. Hence, we provide a support system for the youth to
        work on their personal growth and development and renew their mindset through intentional reading and mentoring.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-2 leading-relaxed text-gray-800">
        TBH Academy courses are designed to teach personal growth and human capacity development courses that are not actively taught
        in schools. This is to supplement the Ghanaian education curriculum and prepare the youth for life.
